# You should know that Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  # The name of our service is "db"
  # but you can use the name of your choice.
  # Note: This may change the commands you are going to use a little bit.
  db:
    # Official Postgres image from DockerHub (we use the last version)
    image: 'postgres:latest'

    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

    env_file:
      - .env # The name of the environment file
      
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: username 
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password

#docker-compose up -> to create the db image / container / with -d you can start these process in the background
#docker-compose start -> starts all services / docker-compose start <service name> to start individual service 
#docker-compose stop -> stops all services / docker-compose stop <service name> to stop individual service
#docker-compose restart -> restarts all services / docker-compose stop <service name> to restart individual service
#docker-compose ps -> shows all created container 
#docker-compose logs <service name>
